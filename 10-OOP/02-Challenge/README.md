# 🧩 Module 10 Project: SVG Logo Maker (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Overview

In this project, you will build a Node.js command-line application that generates a simple logo and saves it as an SVG file.

The application will prompt the user for text, colors, and a shape, then dynamically generate an SVG based on that input. This project emphasizes **object-oriented programming**, **testing with Jest**, and **command-line interaction**.

Because this application is not deployed, you will also record a walkthrough video demonstrating that the application works correctly and that all tests pass.

## 🧠 User Story

As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don’t have to pay a graphic designer.

---

## 🛠️ Application Behavior

The application is run from the command line using:

node index.js

When executed, the application should:

- Prompt the user for up to three characters of text
- Prompt the user for a text color (color keyword or hex value)
- Prompt the user to choose a shape: circle, triangle, or square
- Prompt the user for a shape color (color keyword or hex value)
- Generate an SVG file named logo.svg
- Print the message "Generated logo.svg" to the terminal
- Produce a 300x200 SVG image that matches the user’s input

Opening the logo.svg file in a browser should display the generated logo.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Your project is complete when all of the following are true:

- User input is collected using the Inquirer package
- Text input is limited to three characters
- Color input accepts either color keywords or hexadecimal values
- Shape options include only circle, triangle, and square
- A file named logo.svg is generated after all prompts are completed
- The terminal displays "Generated logo.svg" after file creation
- The SVG renders correctly in the browser at 300x200 pixels

---

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Design Requirements

Your application must include the following classes:

- Triangle
- Circle
- Square

Each shape class must:

- Have a render() method
- Return a string representing its SVG markup
- Accept and apply a color to the SVG shape

It is recommended (but not required) to create a parent Shape class and use inheritance to share common behavior.

Example test that must pass:

const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
shape.render();

Expected output:

  <polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- Jest must be used for unit testing
- Each shape class must have at least one test verifying the render() output
- All tests must pass and be shown in the walkthrough video

## 📁 Suggested Project Structure

.
├── examples/ Example SVG files created by the app
├── lib/ Classes and core logic
│ ├── shapes.js Triangle, Circle, Square classes
│ ├── shapes.test.js Jest tests for shape classes
│ └── additional files as needed
├── .gitignore
├── index.js Entry point for the application
├── package.json
└── README.md Project description and video link

Important:
Make sure the dist folder is not ignored by Git so generated SVG files are tracked.

---

## 🎥 Walkthrough Video Requirements

Your submission must include a walkthrough video that demonstrates:

- Running the application from the command line
- Answering all user prompts
- All Jest tests passing
- A generated SVG file being opened in the browser
- The SVG matching the user’s chosen text, shape, and colors

The README.md file must include a link to this video.

---

## 📦 Submission Checklist

You must submit:

- A GitHub repository with a unique name
- Application source code
- At least one example SVG file generated by the app
- A README.md file with a project description and video link
- A walkthrough video demonstrating functionality and passing tests

---

## 🎯 Goal

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to apply object-oriented programming principles, write unit tests, and build a functional command-line application using Node.js.

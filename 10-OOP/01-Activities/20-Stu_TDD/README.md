# 📐 Add Comments to BlogPost Test Implementations

## Overview

In this activity, you’ll practice reading and understanding test code by adding **clear, meaningful comments**.

Commenting test files helps reinforce what each test is verifying and makes the code easier for other developers to understand and maintain.

---

## 🧠 Your Task

Work with a partner to add comments that explain the purpose and behavior of the test code found in the following files:

- Unsolved/test/BlogPost.test.js
- Unsolved/test/Comment.test.js
- Unsolved/test/ForumItem.test.js

Your comments should describe **what each test is checking** and **why it exists**.

---

## 📝 Helpful Notes

Use the Jest documentation as a reference while reviewing the test files:

Jest — Getting Started  
https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started

Focus on understanding:

- What is being tested
- What inputs are being used
- What outcome is expected

---

## 🛠️ What You’re Practicing

- Reading and interpreting unit tests
- Explaining test intent in plain language
- Improving code readability
- Understanding how tests document behavior

---

## 🏆 Bonus Challenge

Research the concept of **mocking** in testing.

Be ready to explain:

- What a “mock” is
- Why mocks are useful in unit testing
- How Jest can be used to mock a function

Use Google or another search engine to guide your research.

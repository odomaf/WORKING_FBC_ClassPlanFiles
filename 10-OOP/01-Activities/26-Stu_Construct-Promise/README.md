# 📐 Add Comments to a Promise Constructor Implementation

## Overview
In this activity, you’ll practice **reading and understanding asynchronous code** by adding clear comments to an existing implementation that uses the `Promise` constructor.

Commenting asynchronous code helps you better understand how Promises work and makes your code easier for other developers to read and maintain.

---

## 🧠 Your Task
Work with a partner to add comments that explain the functionality of the code found in:

- Unsolved/index.js

Your comments should describe:
- What each part of the Promise constructor is doing
- When the Promise is resolved
- When the Promise is rejected
- How asynchronous behavior is handled

---

## 📝 Helpful Notes
Use the following documentation as reference while reviewing the code:

MDN — Promise Constructor  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise

Node.js — Making HTTP Requests  
https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v16/http/#httpgeturl-options-callback

Focus on understanding **why** the Promise is written the way it is, not just what the syntax looks like.

---

## 🛠️ What You’re Practicing
- Reading and interpreting Promise-based code
- Understanding the Promise constructor
- Recognizing resolve and reject conditions
- Documenting asynchronous logic clearly

---

## 🏆 Bonus Challenge
Research and compare the following Promise utility methods:

- `Promise.all()`
- `Promise.allSettled()`
- `Promise.any()`
- `Promise.race()`

Be prepared to explain how each one behaves and when it would be appropriate to use it.

# 🚀 Project 2 — Interactive Full-Stack Application (Solo Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project is your second major portfolio piece and your **first large-scale solo full-stack application**. The goal is to design, build, and deploy a real-world web application that demonstrates your ability to work independently across the full stack—from database design to deployment.

By the end of this project, you should have a **fully deployed application** you can confidently include in your portfolio and discuss in interviews.

---

## 🧩 Project Requirements

You will build a full-stack application using the skills you’ve learned so far. While your project idea, user story, and features are up to you, your application **must meet the requirements below**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

Your application must:

- Use **Node.js** and **Express.js** to create a RESTful API
- Use **Handlebars.js** as the template engine
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the database
- Include **GET** and **POST** routes
  - `PUT` and `DELETE` routes are optional and may be implemented as stretch goals
- Follow the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** folder structure
- Protect sensitive information using **environment variables**
- Be **deployed on Render**, including database support
- Be **interactive**, responding to user input
- Be **responsive** across different screen sizes
- Include a **polished and professional UI**
- Follow **good coding practices**, including:
  - Clean file structure
  - Clear naming conventions
  - Consistent indentation
  - Helpful and meaningful comments

---

## 🧱 Database Requirements

Your application must include:

- A minimum of **2 database tables**
- At least **5 records per table**

Tables must represent **meaningful application data** (not placeholder or dummy tables).

Seed data may be used to meet the minimum record requirement, but tables should support data being created and retrieved through the application.

---

## 🗄️ Database Options (Choose One)

You may choose **either** database approach:

### Option A — ORM Approach

- PostgreSQL with **Sequelize ORM**

### Option B — SQL-First Approach

- PostgreSQL using the **pg (node-postgres)** npm package
- Write raw SQL queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)

Both approaches are valid and commonly used in industry.

---

## 🔐 Authentication (Optional)

Authentication is **optional** for the solo project.

If you choose to implement authentication, you may use:

- Sessions and cookies
- OAuth-based solutions (e.g., Okta, Clerk, etc.)

You will **not be penalized** for omitting authentication.

---

## 🧪 Exploration Requirement (Required)

Your project must include **at least ONE** of the following:

- An **external API**
- A **new npm package** not covered in class
- A **new frontend or CSS technology**
- A **new backend or tooling concept** approved by your instructor

⚠️ The technology must provide **meaningful functionality**, not just be installed.

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (Optional)

The following features are **optional** and **not required for full credit**, but are strongly encouraged if time allows:

- Add **PUT** and/or **DELETE** routes
- Implement **authentication**
- Create relationships between tables
- Add filtering, sorting, or pagination
- Improve UX with loading states or animations

Stretch goals can help strengthen your portfolio, but **will not negatively impact your grade if omitted**.

---

## 📘 Repository README Requirements

Your repository must include a professional `README.md` with:

- Project name
- Clear project description
- Technologies used
- Screenshot(s) of the application
- Link to the deployed application

---

## 🎤 Presentation Requirements

You will give a short presentation or walkthrough of your project that includes:

- Elevator pitch
- Concept and motivation
- Technical process and challenges
- Live demo
- Future development ideas

---

# 🏗️ Implement process.argv

In this activity, you will practice pulling command-line arguments into your Node.js program using process.argv.

---

## 🎯 USER STORY

As a developer, I want to use command-line arguments as input when writing Node.js applications.

---

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

You are done when:

• You have created an index.js file in this folder.  
• You use process.argv to assign two arguments to variables.  
• You compare those variables to determine if they are the same.  
• The program prints true if they match and false if they do not.

Example usage:

node index.js apple apple  
node index.js 10 20

---

## 🧪 TASKS

1. Log the full process.argv array.
2. Pull process.argv[2] and process.argv[3] into variables.
3. Compare those values using at least one method.
4. Log true or false to the console.

---

## 💡 HINTS

• All command-line arguments come in as strings.  
• You can compare using a conditional, a ternary operator, or by logging the comparison directly.  
• There is more than one correct solution.

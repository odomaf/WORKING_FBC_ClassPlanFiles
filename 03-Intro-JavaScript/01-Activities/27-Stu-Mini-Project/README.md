# 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors — JavaScript Game Logic (27-Stu_Mini-Project)

Work with a partner to build a fully interactive **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game using JavaScript.  
Your program will track scores, use loops, and interact with the player using browser prompts and alerts.

## 🧱 Your Task

- Play 1 round of Rock Paper Scissors and ask to keep playing until the user decides to stop.  
- Store all player statistics inside an **object** (wins, losses, ties, and individual choices).  
- Use `window.prompt()` to get user input and `window.alert()` to display results.  
- Convert user input to **uppercase** to make comparisons consistent.  
- Validate user input so that only `R`, `P`, or `S` are accepted.  
- Use `Math.random()` to randomly select a choice for the computer.  
- Compare choices using conditional statements to determine who wins each round.  
- Ask the player whether they want to **play again** with `window.confirm()`.  
- When the player quits, display a clear **final summary** of their results.

## 💡 Hints

- Store valid options in an array like `["R", "P", "S"]`.  
- Use an object to track how many times each option was chosen by the player.  
- Increment counters inside your game loop whenever a win, loss, or tie occurs.  
- Create a **mapping** (e.g., `{ R: "Rock", P: "Paper", S: "Scissors" }`) to make output messages more readable.  
- Use **template literals** (backticks \`) to build your result strings dynamically.  
- Add **emojis or symbols** (🪨 📄 ✂️) to make your messages more engaging.

## 🧠 Bonus Challenges

- Track **win percentage** for the player.  
- Add **sound effects** or images if you move this to an HTML page later.  
- Implement **score persistence** using `localStorage` so results remain between sessions.  
- Create a **leaderboard system** that logs total games played across multiple users.

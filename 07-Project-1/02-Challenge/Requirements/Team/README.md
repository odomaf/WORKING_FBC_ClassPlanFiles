# Project 1 — Interactive Front-End Application (Team Version, Codecademy Edition)

At the end of each major unit, you’ll work with a small team to build a real-world, interactive front-end web application. This project simulates how software teams work in the industry: planning a product, collaborating on code, integrating APIs, managing tasks, and pitching your finished solution.

Your team will choose the idea, define the user story, and create your own acceptance criteria. The final deliverable includes:
- a deployed application,
- a polished GitHub repository,
- and a team presentation.

====================================================================
CORE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS (TEAM)
====================================================================

Your team’s project must satisfy the following minimum requirements:

1. Use a CSS framework OTHER than Bootstrap.
   Examples: Tailwind, Bulma, Materialize, Pico, DaisyUI, Chakra UI.

2. Use at least TWO server-side APIs.
   Examples: OpenWeather, Giphy, NASA, REST Countries, TMDB, Ticketmaster, PokéAPI.

3. Be interactive.
   The user must be able to trigger updates (search, click, filter, etc.) and see dynamic content rendered to the page.

4. Be responsive.
   The layout should adapt reasonably to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

5. Have a polished, professional UI.
   Consistent spacing, readable text, cohesive components, thoughtful layout.

6. Deploy the application to GitHub Pages.
   Must load successfully with no major console errors.

7. Maintain a clean repository.
   - Clear file/folder organization
   - Clean naming conventions
   - Good indentation and formatting
   - Helpful comments when needed
   - Consistent commit messages from ALL team members

8. Include a high-quality README.md with:
   - Project title
   - Short description
   - Technologies used
   - Screenshots
   - Link to deployed site
   - Link to each team member's LinkedIN so people can contact you!

====================================================================
STRETCH GOALS (OPTIONAL BUT ENCOURAGED)
====================================================================

These are not required but will significantly enhance the project.

1. Add client-side storage (localStorage or sessionStorage)
   For saving favorites, recent searches, preferences, etc.

2. Add at least one custom modal
   Built using HTML/CSS/JS or your framework (not alert/prompt/confirm).

3. Add strong user experience enhancements:
   - loading states
   - skeleton screens
   - placeholder cards
   - animated transitions

4. Add friendlier error handling:
   - no-results messages
   - API error messages
   - retry options

5. Improve accessibility:
   - proper labels
   - logical heading order
   - keyboard navigation
   - ARIA attributes where needed

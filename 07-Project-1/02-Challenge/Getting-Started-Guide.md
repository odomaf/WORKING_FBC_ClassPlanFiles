# Getting Started: How to Plan Your Group Project

Before you write any code, your team needs a plan.  
Follow this process to avoid confusion and finish strong.


## 1. PICK A THEME (CHOOSE ONE)

Discuss as a team which direction excites you:

- Entertainment (movies, games, Pokémon, anime)
- Travel or Geography
- Weather or Outdoors
- Food or Drink
- Personal Productivity
- Science or Space
- Finance or Crypto
- Music or Culture

Your app doesn’t need to be complicated—just focused.


## 2. CHOOSE TWO APIS

Pick APIs that:
- have simple JSON responses,
- don’t require OAuth,
- don’t have painful rate limits,
- and match your theme.

Good beginner APIs:
- OpenWeather
- Giphy
- NASA APOD
- PokéAPI
- TheMealDB
- Ticketmaster
- REST Countries
- OMDb
- Jikan (anime)


## 3. DEFINE YOUR USER STORY


Write a simple, clear statement:

AS A (type of user)  
I WANT (what action)  
SO THAT (what value/purpose)

Example:  
As a traveler, I want to search any city so I can see upcoming concerts and related weather.


## 4. WRITE YOUR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA


These describe the minimum features your MVP must include.

Example:
- User can search for a city.
- API data displays without reloading the page.
- Concert list and weather appear together.
- Site works on desktop + mobile.

Aim for 4–8 acceptance criteria, not 20+.


## 5. CHOOSE YOUR CSS FRAMEWORK


Allowed frameworks include:
- TailwindCSS
- Bulma
- Materialize
- PicoCSS
- DaisyUI
- Chakra UI

Pick one everyone agrees on.

## 6. BREAK DOWN TASKS

Use a shared doc or Trello-style board.

Example task distribution:
- API Research — Person A
- CSS Framework Setup — Person B
- HTML Structure & Components — Person C
- JS API Integration — Person A
- UI Layout & Styling — Person B
- Final Debugging + README — Everyone

Aim for parallel work so nobody blocks the team.

## 7. MAKE A FOLDER STRUCTURE EARLY

Recommended structure:

index.html  
assets/  
  css/  
    style.css  
  js/  
    script.js  
  images/  
README.md

Agree on naming conventions (camelCase, kebab-case, etc.) before coding.


## 8. COMMUNICATE DAILY

Share progress often:
- What you finished
- What you’re stuck on
- What you plan to do next

This prevents surprises in the final week.

## 9. BUILD THE MVP FIRST (NO EXTRAS YET)


MVP = the core features that make the app functional.

After the MVP works:
- then add styling,
- then animations,
- then stretch goals (localStorage, modal, dark mode, etc.).

## 10. PRACTICE THE PRESENTATION

On the final day, your pitch should feel organized, not improvised.

Cover:
- The problem  
- The solution  
- How it works  
- Demo  
- Future improvements  
- Who did what  

Every team member speaks.

SUCCESS COMES FROM:

Planning → Communication → A solid MVP → THEN enhancements.

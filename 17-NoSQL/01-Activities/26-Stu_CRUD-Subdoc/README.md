# 26-Stu_CRUD_Subdoc — Comment Mongoose CRUD + Subdocuments

In this activity, you’ll work with a partner to **read real controller code** and add comments explaining what each CRUD operation is doing.

This is a core job skill: being able to explain existing code clearly.

---

## What You’re Commenting

Open:

- `Solved/controllers/appController.js`

Your goal is to explain the intent of each operation:

- `find()` / `findById()` (Read)
- `create()` (Create)
- `findByIdAndUpdate()` (Update)
- `findByIdAndDelete()` (Delete)
- `$addToSet` / `$pull` (subdocument array operations)

---

## Setup

From the `Solved/` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```

# 🚀 Project 2 — Interactive Full-Stack Application (Team Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project is your second major portfolio piece and your first large-scale **full-stack group application**. The goal is to design, build, and deploy a real-world web application that demonstrates both your technical skills **and** your ability to collaborate effectively with other developers.

By the end of this project, your team should have a **fully deployed application** that you can confidently show to employers.

---

## 🧩 Project Requirements

Your group will build a full-stack application using everything you’ve learned so far. Your application **must meet the requirements below**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

Your application must:

- Use **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- Use **Handlebars.js**
- Use **PostgreSQL**
- Include **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE** routes
- Follow the **MVC** folder structure
- Implement **user authentication**
- Use **environment variables**
- Be **deployed on Render**
- Be **interactive**, **responsive**, and **polished**

- At least **5 records per table**

Tables must represent **meaningful application data**.

---

## 🗄️ Database Options (Choose One)

- **Sequelize ORM**

## 🔗 Recommended (Not Required): Table Relationships & Joins

While not required for full credit, teams are **strongly encouraged** to:

- Define relationships between tables (one-to-many or many-to-many)

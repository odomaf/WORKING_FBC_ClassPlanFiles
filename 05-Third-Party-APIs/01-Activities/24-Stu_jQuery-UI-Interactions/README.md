## 📖 Implement a Sortable List with Drag and Drop

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

> As a user, I want to be able to sort my list of skills using the cursor to drag and drop them.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The list of skills can be reordered using drag-and-drop.
- [ ] A visible **placeholder** appears to show where the dragged item will be dropped.

---

## 📝 Notes

Use the jQuery UI documentation:

- jQuery UI Demos: <https://jqueryui.com/demos/>
- Look for the **Sortable** interaction and the `placeholder` option.

---

## 💡 Hint

Think about which **interaction** (not widget) allows a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.

You’ll be working with:

```js
$('#skills-list').sortable({...});
```

---

## 🏆 Bonus

- [ ] Add a handle icon so only the icon can be dragged.

- [ ] Restrict sorting to the vertical axis.

- [ ] Research: How can we implement drag-and-drop without jQuery, using modern browser APIs?

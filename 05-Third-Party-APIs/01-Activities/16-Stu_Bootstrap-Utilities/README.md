# 🧱 16-Stu_Bootstrap-Utilities

## 📖 Your Task

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

> _As a developer, I want to center my form on the page and style it using Bootstrap utilities — without writing custom CSS._

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The page background is **dark**.
- The form has a **white background** and **rounded corners**.
- The header text is **white and centered**.
- The form is **centered vertically and horizontally** on the screen.

---

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Add Bootstrap utility classes directly in the `class` attributes — no CSS file is needed!
3. Experiment with:
   - `bg-*` for background colors
   - `text-*` for text colors
   - `d-flex`, `justify-content-*`, and `align-items-*` for centering
   - `min-vh-100` for full-screen height
   - `p-*` and `m-*` for padding and margin

## 💡 Hints

- Use `.min-vh-100` to make an element the height of the viewport.
- Combine `.d-flex`, `.align-items-center`, and `.justify-content-center` for full centering.
- Use `.rounded` and `.shadow` to polish your form box.

## 🏆 Bonus

- Try different color themes (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-warning`) for variety.
- Use Chrome DevTools to test spacing adjustments live.

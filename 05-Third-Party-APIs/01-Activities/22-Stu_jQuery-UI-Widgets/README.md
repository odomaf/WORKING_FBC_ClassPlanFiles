## 📖 Enhance UI with jQuery UI Widgets

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

- As a user, I want to easily choose a skill from a list to use in the form.
- As a user, I want to easily select a date from a datepicker instead of writing it out manually.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The **Skill Name** input uses **jQuery UI Autocomplete** with a list of skills.
- [ ] The **Date** input uses **jQuery UI Datepicker** and allows selecting **month and year** from dropdowns.

---

## 📝 Notes

Use the official jQuery UI demos to guide your implementation:

- jQuery UI Demos: <https://jqueryui.com/demos/>
- Focus on:
  - Autocomplete
  - Datepicker → “Display month & year menus”

---

## 💡 Hints

- Create an array of common web dev skills, for example:

  ```js
  const skillNames = [
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "JavaScript",
    "jQuery",
    "Bootstrap",
    "React",
    "Node.js",
    "Python",
  ];
  ```

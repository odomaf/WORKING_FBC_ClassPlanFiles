# 📐 Add Comments: Sequelize Session Store and Cookies

Work with a group to add clear, helpful comments that explain how sessions and cookies are configured in this application.

Your goal is to describe the purpose of the code found in:

- [server.js](./Unsolved/server.js)

Focus on explaining **what each part does** and **why it is needed**, not rewriting or changing the logic.

## 📝 Notes

Use the following documentation as a reference while you work:

- [express-session documentation (cookies and options)](https://github.com/expressjs/session#cookie)

---

## 🏆 Bonus

If you complete the main task early, discuss the following with your group:

- What is the difference between **sessions** and **cookies**?
- How do they work together to keep a user logged in?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this topic.

# 📖 Conditionally Display Food Allergens (Street Eats Night)

In this activity, you’ll work with your group to add allergen awareness to the Street Eats Night menu using Handlebars.

You’ll practice **conditionally rendering content** based on the data passed from the server.

## 🧠 User Goal

- As a guest browsing the Street Eats Night menu, I want to quickly see which dishes contain nuts so I can make an informed choice.

## ✅ Success Criteria

This activity is complete when:

- dishes that contain nuts display a clear **“⚠️ Contains nuts”** message
- dishes without nuts do **not** display the warning
- the logic lives in the **view**, not in the route

## 📚 Helpful Reference

- [Handlebars built-in helpers – conditional rendering](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#if)

## 💡 Hint

Which Handlebars helper allows you to render a block **only when a condition is true**?

## 🌶️ Bonus Challenge

If your group finishes early, discuss and research:

- Which Handlebars helper does the opposite of `#if`?
- When would it be useful to render content when a value is **false**, **null**, or **undefined**?

Be ready to share a real-world example with the class.

# 📐 Add Comments to the Login and Authentication Flow

Work with your group to add clear, meaningful comments that explain what the following files are doing and how they work together to support user login and authentication:

- [Unsolved/server.js](./Unsolved/server.js)
- [Unsolved/controllers/api/userRoutes.js](./Unsolved/controllers/api/userRoutes.js)
- [Unsolved/utils/auth.js](./Unsolved/utils/auth.js)
- [Unsolved/controllers/homeRoutes.js](./Unsolved/controllers/homeRoutes.js)
- [Unsolved/views/layouts/main.handlebars](./Unsolved/views/layouts/main.handlebars)
- [Unsolved/public/js/login.js](./Unsolved/public/js/login.js)
- [Unsolved/public/js/logout.js](./Unsolved/public/js/logout.js)

Your goal is to describe:

- How users log in and log out
- How sessions are created and destroyed
- How protected routes are enforced
- How the front end and back end communicate during authentication

## 🏆 Bonus

After completing the required comments, explore the following question with your group:

- What other libraries or strategies can be used to handle authentication in a Node.js application?

Use a search engine or official documentation to research alternatives.

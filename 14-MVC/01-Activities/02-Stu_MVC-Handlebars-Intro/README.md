# 📐 Add Comments: MVC + Handlebars (Street Eats Night)

In this activity, you’ll work with your group to add clear, helpful comments that explain **what the code is doing** and **how each file fits into the MVC pattern**.

You will add comments to these files:

- `models/Dish.js`
- `views/layouts/main.handlebars`
- `controllers/dish-routes.js`

## ✅ Your Goal

By the end, someone new to the project should be able to read your comments and understand:

- which files represent the **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**
- how data and requests flow through the app
- what Handlebars is responsible for rendering on the page

## 🧭 Tips While You Work

- Don’t just describe syntax—describe **purpose**.
- Use “when a user visits this route…” language for controller routes.
- For models, focus on **data shape**, **fields**, and **why we define them**.
- For Handlebars layouts, explain how templates get combined into a final page.

## 🌶️ Bonus Challenge

If your group finishes early, research and discuss:

- What are a few other **template engines** besides Handlebars?
- Why might a team choose one template engine over another?

Use a search engine and be ready to share 1–2 examples with the class.

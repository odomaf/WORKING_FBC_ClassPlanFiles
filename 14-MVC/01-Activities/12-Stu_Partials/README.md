# 🏗️ Use Handlebars.js Partials to Reuse a Template

Work with a group to complete the following activity.

## 🎯 User Story

- As a developer, I want to render details of a painting by reusing the same Handlebars.js template so my views are consistent and easier to maintain.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

This activity is complete when:

- The details for the paintings associated with the gallery are rendered using a Handlebars.js partial in the  
  [gallery.handlebars](./Unsolved/views/gallery.handlebars) file.

- The `painting-details.handlebars` partial renders a **card** that links to the individual painting’s page.

- The card includes:
  - a header displaying the **painting title**
  - a body displaying the **painting image** and the **artist’s name**

## 🖼️ Assets

The following image demonstrates how the painting details should appear on the page:

## 💡 Hints

As you work through this activity, consider the following:

- Without a signup form, how can new users be added to the database quickly?
- What needs to happen to Sequelize model data before it can be passed into a Handlebars.js template?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you complete the main task early, research and discuss the following:

- What are some other architectural paradigms besides MVC?
- In what situations might those patterns be useful?

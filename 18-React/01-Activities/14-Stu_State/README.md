# 🔢 React State: Click Counter

## 🎯 Activity

Work with a partner to add clear, helpful comments to the code found in:

`Unsolved/src/components`

Your goal is to explain **what the code is doing** and **why it works**, focusing on:

- `useState`
- event handlers
- passing props from parent → child

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

You are done when:

- You add comments explaining how `useState` works in `Counter.jsx`
- You add comments explaining what each click handler does
- You add comments explaining what props are being passed into `CardBody`
- Your comments are clear enough that another student could understand the component flow

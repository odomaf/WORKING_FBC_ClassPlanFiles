## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Your work is complete when:

- You add **inline styles** to the `Header`, `Navbar`, and `Section` components.

- The rendered page looks **similar to the inline-styled example** shown in the image below — using **only inline styles** (and **without editing any CSS files**).

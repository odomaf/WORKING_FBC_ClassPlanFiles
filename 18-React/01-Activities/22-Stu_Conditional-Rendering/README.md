# Week 18 — Conditional Rendering (Student Activity)

## 🎯 Goal

In this activity, you’ll practice **reading React code** and writing clear comments that explain:

- How conditional rendering works (render different UI based on state/props)
- How props are passed from a parent component to a child component
- How object destructuring makes props easier to use

This is a real-world skill: developers spend a lot of time reading code and leaving helpful comments for teammates.

---

## 🧩 Activity

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in:

- `Unsolved/src/components/PortfolioContainer.jsx`
- `Unsolved/src/components/NavTabs.jsx`

You are not changing behavior — you are explaining what is already happening.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

This activity is complete when:

- `PortfolioContainer.jsx` contains comments explaining:
  - the purpose of `currentPage` state
  - what `renderPage()` does
  - what props are being passed into `NavTabs`
  - why `{renderPage()}` is inside the `<main>`

- `NavTabs.jsx` contains comments explaining:
  - how props are destructured in the function parameter
  - how clicking a tab changes the page
  - how the ternary operator controls the active tab class

## 🏆 Bonus

Discuss with your partner:

Where would conditional rendering be helpful in a real app?

Examples:

- Logged in vs logged out UI
- Loading spinner vs data
- Error state vs success state
- Showing/hiding a modal
- Admin-only buttons

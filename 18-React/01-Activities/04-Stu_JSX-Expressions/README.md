# 🏗️ Implement JSX Expressions

## 🎯 Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

> As a developer, I want to use JSX expressions to dynamically render JavaScript variables inside my React components.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Your task is complete when:

- You create the required JavaScript variables inside  
  `Unsolved/src/components/JSXVariables.jsx`

- You create a variable called `name` that stores your name.

- You render the value of the `name` variable inside JSX.

- You render the number of letters in the `name` variable.

- You create a variable called `thoughts` that contains a short string describing your thoughts on React.

---

## 💡 Hints

- Remember that JSX allows you to embed JavaScript inside `{ }`.
- Any valid JavaScript expression can be placed inside curly braces.
- You can access string properties like `.length`.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you finish early:

- What other JavaScript string or array methods could you use with the `name` variable?
- Could you manipulate the name before rendering it?

Use a search engine to explore additional methods and experiment.

## 🧠 Key Concept

JSX expressions allow us to dynamically insert JavaScript values directly into our UI.  
This is one of the core reasons React is powerful.
